# themerchantengine

## 1.1.0

The first release of the engine as a product.

### Major Changes

- Runtime client config: store identity, brand palette, locale pair, money
  and domains live in `StoreSetting` and are served on `GET /v1/store/config`.
  The storefront renders its tokens, locale routing and money formats from
  it at SSR; the admin renders its editors, money inputs and shell identity
  from it. No client branch, no build per client.
- The install stepper: `./setup.sh` (Linux, macOS) and `./setup.ps1`
  (Windows, local profile) run `tools/setup`, which asks for every
  store-specific value once, verifies storage, mail, bot protection and the
  optional search-engine integrations live, renders the compose stack, the
  nginx vhosts and the timers from `deploy/templates/`, builds the images on
  the box, installs the schema, the seeds and the owner account, issues TLS
  and probes the result. Profiles: `engine`, `storefront`, `both`, `local`.
- An offline Ed25519-signed license verified at setup and at boot, with an
  admin banner and a grace period on expiry.
- Admin light mode, a semantic token layer, settings screens for identity,
  brand (with a palette preview and contrast report), localization, money,
  domains and the license.
- A brandless tree, guarded by `verify:no-client-refs` on every push, and
  scenario fixtures (`gulf-rtl`, `maghreb-ltr`, `demo`) every locale, money
  and e2e matrix runs against.
- Deploy templates with no client value, an operator manual at
  `deploy/README.md`, a generic GitHub Actions pipeline with an install
  smoke job, secret scanning, and `npm run release`.

## Pre-release history

Internal work before the engine became a product, kept for reference.

### Minor Changes

- Phase 20, Notifications + Global search: shipped NotificationTemplate +
  NotificationLog Prisma models, `/v1/admin/notifications/{templates,log,log/:id/resend}`
  CRUD, `/v1/admin/search` cross-entity fan-out, 3 notification admin
  screens, a Cmd+K global search overlay replacing the nav-only palette,
  and a `/search` full-page results route. 15 new api unit tests
  (958 total), 30 new admin tests (484 total).

  Phase 21, Quality gates: tightened admin bundle budgets (900 kB
  initial error ceiling, 80 kB main-bundle guard), whitelisted
  sanitize-html CJS, shipped `lighthouserc.json` + GitHub Actions
  workflow running lint + test + budget + Lighthouse on every admin
  PR. Local LHCI known-broken on Windows+Node 22; documented as
  CI-only.

  Phase 22, Docs + handoff: README rewritten to cover the full Nx
  monorepo; `docs/deployment.md` §13 added for admin static-host +
  SPA fallback + CSP + cookie scoping; `/dev/design-system` demo
  extended with every primitive shipped after Phase 3 (Icon, KPI card,
  Sparkline, Tab strip, Translatable input, Rich text editor, Dropzone).

  Sentry wiring: env-var-driven init on both apps, inert without a DSN.
  `captureException` called from `HttpExceptionFilter` on unmapped
  Prisma/unknown errors and from `GlobalErrorHandler` on uncaught +
  5xx ApiError. PII scrubbed in `beforeSend`.

  Changesets tooling: wired `@changesets/cli` for CHANGELOG generation.
