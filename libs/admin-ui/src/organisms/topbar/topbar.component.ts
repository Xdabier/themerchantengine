/**
 * Presentational topbar. Mobile (below `md`): hamburger, wordmark, the theme
 * toggle (`topbarStart`) and the user slot (`topbarUser`), which carries the
 * account menu and sign-out. `md` and up: notifications joins in, sized to fit a 260 px sidebar plus this header in the
 * narrowest width that breakpoint promises (768 px, `agent_docs/admin/
 * responsive-rules.md`). The store identity chip and the search trigger are
 * both desktop conveniences rather than a distinct action, so they wait for
 * `lg` (1024 px): the identity chip is decorative (see below), and the search
 * trigger duplicates the always-live Cmd/Ctrl+K shortcut, so hiding its button
 * between `md` and `lg` drops no capability, only one discovery affordance,
 * for the width range that has no room to spare for it.
 *
 * The store's name and mark render here in `--ink-muted`, the colour of the
 * engine label they replace on desktop. The store's own palette never follows
 * them in: this is the admin, and constitution §3.9 keeps the admin on the
 * Badii Studio floor in both colour modes. The mobile wordmark is the engine's
 * identity and stays.
 *
 * The block has a fixed inline size and truncates. A visual baseline masks it,
 * and a mask paints the located element's bounding box, so a variable width
 * would couple every masked baseline to the store name of whichever scenario
 * fixture recorded it.
 *
 * Slots:
 *   <span topbarStart>...</span>   — visible at every width, mobile included
 *                                     (the theme toggle lives here)
 *   <span topbarEnd>...</span>     — desktop-only (md+), after search,
 *                                     before user menu (notifications lives here)
 *   <span topbarUser>...</span>    — visible at every width: the account menu
 *                                     and sign-out, which a phone must reach

        Everything in this wrapper is desktop-only per the class doc above
        ("Mobile: hamburger, wordmark, and the theme toggle"). 'hidden
        md:contents' keeps that below md: the wrapper and its children render
        nothing (and take no header width), and at md and up 'display:
        contents' lets each projected child participate directly in the
        header's own flex layout, so the gap-3/md:gap-6 spacing between them
        is unchanged. Without this wrapper the slotted content (search,
        notifications, account menu, sign-out) rendered unconditionally and
        overflowed a 360 px viewport: the header has no room for that many
        controls at once below md, and the mobile nav (hamburger) is this
        component's answer for navigation, not for these actions.

        Outside the wrapper on purpose. The topbarUser slot carries the account
        menu and sign-out, and an operator who cannot sign out on a phone has
        no way to end their session at all: the mobile drawer is navigation
        only, and nothing else in the shell offers it. Hiding it below md
        traded an overflow for a lost capability, which is the wrong trade. It
        is the controls that duplicate something else, the search trigger
        behind a live shortcut and the decorative identity chip, that give up
        their width instead.
