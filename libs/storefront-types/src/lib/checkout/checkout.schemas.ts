 * Storefront checkout bootstrap schemas — `GET /v1/checkout/settings`.
 *
 * The endpoint answers the two questions the checkout page has to settle
 * before it can render anything: may an anonymous visitor proceed, and which
 * tenders does the operator offer. Both halves used to be admin-only, so the
 * settings round-tripped into a void and the payment-methods module was dead
 * config (findings K3, D1, D3).
 *
 * `name` and `description` are Translatable JSONB on the API side and arrive
 * as plain strings, resolved by the global interceptor against the request's
 * `X-Locale` / `Accept-Language`. Typing them as `string` is deliberate: an
 * object here means the locale header did not travel, and a checkout that
 * renders `[object Object]` as a tender name is worse than one that fails.

 * projection fails checkout loudly rather than quietly publishing a live key.
