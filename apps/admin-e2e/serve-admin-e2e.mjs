/**
 * Admin dev-server launcher for the e2e suite.
 *
 * Plan H / Phase H0, decision D3. The suite used to carry a second webServer
 * branch that served the admin with `proxy.conf.e2e.dev.json`, whose target was
 * the DEV API on 53000. That branch existed for one real reason: on Windows a
 * Hyper-V dynamic-port exclusion can reserve 53001, and the suite then could
 * not run at all. The fix it chose was to point the whole suite at the dev
 * stack, which is how e2e fixtures reached the developer's dev database.
 *
 * The legitimate half of that need is a port override, so this launcher gives
 * one. `E2E_API_PORT` moves the test API, `ADMIN_DEV_PORT` moves the admin dev
 * server, and the proxy config is GENERATED from whatever they say rather than
 * chosen from two committed files. Live-backend semantics are never traded
 * away, so the identity guard still holds on every path.
 *
 * Generating the config in the launcher rather than in Playwright's
 * `globalSetup` is deliberate: Playwright starts `webServer` before
 * `globalSetup`, and depending on that ordering is depending on an
 * implementation detail. Here the file exists before `nx serve` reads it,
 * because the same process writes it.
