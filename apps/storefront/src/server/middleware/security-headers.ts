/**
 * Storefront Nitro middleware that emits the security response headers
 * documented in `agent_docs/security.md` §"XSS Prevention / Headers".
 *
 * The API serves its own headers via the Nest CORS + Helmet stack; the
 * storefront origin needs the same defense-in-depth posture for the
 * authenticated surfaces (`/account/*`, `/checkout`) where missing
 * headers would let a hostile origin frame the page or where an XSS
 * regression would have no in-browser CSP boundary to limit blast.
 *
 * Header rationale:
 *  - X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff      — prevent MIME-type sniffing.
 *  - X-Frame-Options: DENY                — clickjacking defense; CSP
 *                                          frame-ancestors is the
 *                                          forward-looking version, but
 *                                          XFO is the universal floor.
 *  - Referrer-Policy: strict-origin-when-cross-origin
 *                                          — limits cross-origin referrer
 *                                            leakage for product / order
 *                                            URLs.
 *  - Strict-Transport-Security: max-age=63072000; includeSubDomains; preload
 *                                          — set only when NODE_ENV=production
 *                                            so dev over plain HTTP is not
 *                                            HSTS-pinned for two years.
 *  - Content-Security-Policy                — restrictive starter that
 *                                            permits Analog's hydration
 *                                            inline runtime via 'self' +
 *                                            'unsafe-inline' on style only.
 *                                            script-src is locked to 'self'
 *                                            so any future inline-script
 *                                            regression triggers CSP.
 *
 * Customer-facing surfaces (sitemap_index.xml, robots.txt, llms.txt)
 * are served from `apps/storefront/src/server/routes/*.ts` via the same
 * Nitro pipeline so they receive these headers automatically.
 *
 * The internal `/api/_internal/revalidate` endpoint also receives these
 * headers — harmless on a backend-to-backend POST and consistent with the
 * defense-in-depth principle that every storefront response should carry
 * the same baseline headers.

  // CSP starter. `'unsafe-inline'` is permitted on style only because
  // Angular SSR emits inline component styles via `<style>` tags; the
  // forward path is style hashes once the bundle stabilises. `script-src`
  // is locked to 'self' (+ Cloudflare Turnstile, below) so any inline
  // `<script>` regression triggers CSP — JSON-LD
  // `<script type="application/ld+json">` is parsed as data, not executed,
  // and is not gated by `script-src`.
  //
  // Cloudflare Turnstile (bot defense on the sign-up + newsletter forms) loads
  // `https://challenges.cloudflare.com/turnstile/v0/api.js` and renders its
  // challenge in an iframe from the same origin. Per Cloudflare's CSP guidance
  // that host must be allowed in BOTH `script-src` (the api.js) and `frame-src`
  // (the challenge iframe) — without `frame-src` the iframe falls back to
  // `default-src 'self'` and the widget silently fails to load, blocking real
  // users from submitting (the server still rejects tokenless requests).
  //
  // The per-request nonce covers the two inline scripts Angular emits for
  // hydration event replay: `ng-event-dispatch-contract` and the
  // `window.__jsaction_bootstrap(...)` call that arms it. Without it both are
  // refused in every browser, so event replay is inert and every page load
  // reports two violations. `'self'` still applies alongside the nonce, since
  // there is no `'strict-dynamic'` here, so an injected inline script without
  // the nonce is still refused. `app.config.server.ts` reads the same value
  // back off the request to provide Angular's CSP_NONCE.
  //
  // The hash covers the second one, the event-dispatch contract, which the
  // builder inlines into index.html at build time so nothing per-request can
  // stamp an attribute onto it. Its spec re-derives the hash from the installed
  // Angular package, so an upgrade that changes the script fails a test rather
  // than quietly disarming event replay.
