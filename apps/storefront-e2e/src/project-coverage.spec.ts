/**
 * Every spec file must be collected by at least one project.
 *
 * Each project in `playwright.config.ts` carries an explicit `testMatch`
 * allowlist naming every spec by hand. A spec that nobody adds to one of those
 * lists is not skipped and does not error: it collects zero tests, and the run
 * is green because nothing ran. The file exists, the assertions inside it look
 * thorough, an auditor greps for it and finds it, and it has never once
 * executed.
 *
 * This has happened here before. The config's own comment above the
 * `desktop-chromium-1440` project records three specs that "collected zero
 * tests under every run while still reading as covered: two of them are
 * locale-matrix specs that auditors counted as compliant". It happened again
 * at D8 with `loader-404.journey.spec.ts`, which is why this guard exists
 * rather than another comment.
 *
 * The rule is per-file rather than per-project on purpose. Which projects a
 * spec runs under is a real scoping decision, and several are deliberately
 * narrowed: WebKit skips the specs that need hydration under the Vite dev
 * server, and the mobile projects lag the desktop one until a spec has a run's
 * worth of history. Nothing here second-guesses that. It only insists the
 * answer is not "none".
